# EduRise: A GEN-AI Enabled Framework for Increasing Enrolment in Government Schools

EduRise is a GEN-AI powered decision-support framework designed to help government school systems in India
**predict**, **explain**, and **improve** student enrolment.

It combines:

- **Predictive Modelling (ML)** – flags schools at risk of enrolment decline  
- **Explainable AI (XAI)** – surfaces the key factors driving that risk  
- **Generative AI (LLM)** – converts analytics into **action plans**, **parent messages**, and **policy briefs**  

The aim is to move from *static, descriptive reports* to **proactive, localised interventions**.

## 1. Problem Motivation

Despite schemes like **Samagra Shiksha**, **PM SHRI**, and **NIPUN Bharat**, many government schools continue to
face **declining enrolment** as parents shift to private schools.

- Rich datasets exist: **U-DISE+**, **NAS**, Census-like socio-economic data  
- But they are used mainly for **descriptive reporting**, not **early-warning and intervention**  
- Administrators lack a tool that can answer three questions:

1. **Where** will enrolment likely drop?  
2. **Why** is it likely to drop there?  
3. **What** should we do about it, in simple, local language?

EduRise directly targets this gap ,

## 2. Solution Overview

EduRise follows a **Predict – Explain – Engage** pipeline:

1. **Predict**  
   - Train tree-based models (Random Forest / XGBoost) on U-DISE-like data  
   - Predict **enrolment change** or **risk buckets** (decline / stable / growth) per school  

2. **Explain (XAI)**  
   - Use **SHAP** or fallback feature importances  
   - Rank features driving each school’s prediction (e.g., pupil-teacher ratio, infrastructure, NAS scores)  

3. **Engage (GEN-AI)**  
   - Pass predictions + explanations to an **LLM** (e.g., GPT-4 / local LLM)  
   - Generate:
     - Action plans for head teachers / BEO / DEO  
     - Short parent messages in local languages  
     - Policy notes for district-level planning  

Results are delivered through a **simple web dashboard** (Streamlit/Flask).
